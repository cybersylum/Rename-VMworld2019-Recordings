# Rename-VMworld2019-Recordings

A script to complement the torrent file created by Tim Borland (@Borlandts).  You can find information on his creation at https://medium.com/@timothy.borland/vmworld-2019-session-recordings-6409959b876e

Once you have downloaded the files, this script will add the Session Description to the filenames of the recordings.  I wrote this to make the library in my Plex a bit easier to read.  I hope you enjoy it!  

Usage:

Download both files (us.txt and renameVMworldSessionFiles.ps1)

./renameVMworldSessionFiles.ps1 <path to us.txt> <path to session recording directory>
  
  
  
The script and us.txt are based on https://github.com/lamw/vmworld2019-session-urls by @wlam
